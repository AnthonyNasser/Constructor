# Constructor
This is a two-player desktop game I made with Unity and C# scripting, but I lost the code when I formatted my old laptop. 
However, this is probably for the best because I was only just beginning to learn how to program. It is still downloadable for windows machines,
but wouldn't reccomend downloading it unless you are looking for an awful user experience.

## How to Play
The right side uses the arrow keys while the left side uses A, Z, and S. 
Collect stars on the far end of your block and use them to either grow your block or shoot at the enemies laser. The game doesn't actually end 
if one of the player's lives run out, so you'll just have to go by the honor system lol.
